The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction. The individual line items that you enter in a transaction determine the amounts that post when you process that transaction. The following Cost Estimate Types on Items are available: * Item Defined Cost - a user-defined amount, entered into the Item Defined Cost field on the Item definition page. * Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default. * Preferred Vendor Rate - This option is only used if the Multi-Vendor feature is enabled and multiple vendors supply the same item. o First priority is to use the preferred vendor rate if defined on the Item record. o Next priority would be to use the purchase price. o Last priority would be the purchase order rate. (Initially this uses the preferred vendor rate cost, and then after a purchase order is entered, this type uses the most recent actual purchase order rate. Special orders and drop-shipped items use this cost information.) * Derived from member items - Total costs of items currently included in a kit. This Cost Estimate Type only applies to kits and sums the estimated costs of each item in the kit, based on each of their individual Cost Estimate Types. Uses the latest definition of the kit, not its historical definition.

A typical use for this option is to identify items whose revenue recognition depends on the delivery of the item in addition to the delivery of a separate service. For example, a specified upgrade would typically be marked Defer Bundle Until Delivered. * Defer Until Item Delivered - Until this item is marked delivered, the item revenue recognition is deferred. This is the default field setting. Note: The deferral setting you choose for each item in a bundle works with the deferral settings for other items in the bundle.

The item discounted sales amount is the revenue amount. * Software - The item is software. When you use VSOE with the EITF SuiteApp, both EITF 08-01 and SOP 97-2 rules apply for revenue allocation. When you use advanced revenue management, revenue allocation follows the fair value price list. Then if the fair value prices for any of the items in the allocation are estimates rather than VSOE, the allocation is recalculated using the residual method. Note: Do not select the Software value unless you are using VSOE with the EITF SuiteApp or Advanced Revenue Management.
